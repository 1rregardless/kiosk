## What Is OpenKiosk?

The name *OpenKiosk* is a little misleading because this repository is a group of crx and other application files I dumped from my school chromebook using a little bug that has gone unpatched for several months.

## Why?

Because its fun. (I do not condone cheating using these files)

## How Can I get the same files from my chromebook?

LTBeef. open crosh (ctrl+alt+t) then run set_cellular_ppp \';bash;\' to open up a bash prompt. From there I just tar cvf and tar czvf'd the /home/chronos and /home/user directories.
